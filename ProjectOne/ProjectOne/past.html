        <h2>Thank you for coming to the page about Mike's past!</h2>
        <p>Mike Ehrmantraut's past as a former police officer in Philadelphia deeply influences his character in Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. His principled stance against corruption within the force led to his son Matt’s tragic death, a pivotal event that drives much of Mike’s subsequent actions. Disillusioned by the system, Mike transitions to a role as a private investigator and enforcer, leveraging his law enforcement skills in the criminal world.</p>
